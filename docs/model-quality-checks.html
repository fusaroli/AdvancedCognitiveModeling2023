<p>Model quality checks are crucial for understanding how well our Bayesian models capture the underlying data-generating process. We’ll use three primary techniques:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Prior Predictive Checks</li>
<li>Posterior Predictive Checks</li>
<li>Prior-Posterior Update Visualization</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">11.2</span> Prior and Posterior Predictive Checks<a href="model-quality-checks.html#prior-and-posterior-predictive-checks" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Prior predictive checks help us understand what our model assumes about the world before seeing any data. They answer the question: “What kind of data would we expect to see if we only used our prior beliefs?” Posterior predictive checks are the same, but after having seen the data. This helps us assess whether the model can generate data that looks similar to our observed data.</p>

There is a risk that those random numbers are not statistically sound and the overall results might be invalid. To fix this, specify &#39;seed=TRUE&#39;. This ensures that proper, parallel-safe random numbers are produced via the L&#39;Ecuyer-CMRG method. To disable this check, use &#39;seed=NULL&#39;, or set option &#39;future.rng.onMisuse&#39; to &quot;ignore&quot;.
