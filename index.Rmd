# Advanced Cognitive Modeling 

These course notes support the Advanced Cognitive Modeling course taught in the Master's program in Cognitive Science at Aarhus University. The course represents a journey into how we can understand cognitive processes through the formalization and implementation of hypothesized mechanisms, their testing and validation.

## Course Philosophy and Approach

Advanced cognitive modeling focuses on three interrelated objectives that shape how we approach the modeling of cognitive processes:

The first objective centers on understanding the thought process behind model development. Rather than simply providing a toolbox of existing scripts, we explore how cognitive models are conceptualized and constructed from the ground up. This approach ensures you develop the skills to create novel models for unique research questions.

The second objective emphasizes mastering the Bayesian workflow essential for robust model development. This workflow encompasses simulation design, prior assessment, parameter recovery testing, and thorough model fit evaluation. These skills ensure your models are not just theoretically sound but also practically reliable and generalize way beyond cognitive modeling.

The third objective focuses on developing advanced probabilistic modeling capabilities. Through hands-on experience with Stan, you will learn to implement increasingly sophisticated models while maintaining scientific rigor.

## Course Structure and Learning Path

The course follows a carefully structured progression that builds your modeling capabilities step by step:

After a deepdive into the physics of pizza ovens, we begin with simple scenarios that introduce fundamental modeling concepts. Each subsequent chapter introduces new modeling techniques while building upon previous knowledge. This cumulative approach ensures you develop a deep understanding of both basic principles and advanced applications.

The chapters include theoretical discussions paired with practical coding exercises. During practical sessions, we work with real datasets, design models collaboratively, and implement them using modern statistical tools. This hands-on approach provides ample opportunity for questions and exploration.

The course schedule maintains flexibility to adapt to the collective learning pace of each cohort. While we have clear learning objectives, we ensure everyone develops a solid foundation before moving to more advanced topics.
